    <h1>KetoSoy</h1>
    

<p>I&rsquo;ve been consuming <a href="http://www.ketosoy.com">KetoSoy</a> for about a month now.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-it:1f2ff74c1d28d8917c4851633b66f3c1">What is it?</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>KetoSoy is a chocolate flavored meal replacement shake engineered to make the ketogenic diet easy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is similar in idea to <a href="https://www.soylent.com">Soylent</a>, though with a very different ingredient profile.</p>

<p>The main difference between the two is carbohydrates. Soylent is high in carbohydrates. KetoSoy is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/02/health/low-carb-vs-low-fat-diet.html">high in fat</a> and low in carbohydrates to keep you in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketosis">ketosis</a>.</p>

<p>For one serving:</p>

<h3 id="why:1f2ff74c1d28d8917c4851633b66f3c1">Why?</h3>

<p>I saw KetoSoy mentioned on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/soylent/comments/2o02kx/as_promised_ketosoy_the_ketogenic_soylent_is_now/">Reddit</a> while checking up on the state of Soylent. The ingredient profile of Soylent never appealed to me, but KetoSoy&rsquo;s looked right up my alley.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been aiming for a high-fat, low-carb, Paleo-ish diet for about a year now. I don&rsquo;t cook at home; I eat out exclusively (or in, with <a href="https://munchery.com">Munchery</a>). I wanted an alternative for the times that I didn&rsquo;t really want to go out, when Munchery&rsquo;s menu didn&rsquo;t look enticing, or when I wanted to limit my caloric intake.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also much cheaper than going out: with the monthly subscription a 15-day supply comes out to $10 <strong>per day</strong> (without the subscription, $12.50). Adding the extra protein powder and chia seeds does increase this, but only slightly.</p>

<h3 id="how:1f2ff74c1d28d8917c4851633b66f3c1">How?</h3>

<p>To prepare a day&rsquo;s worth (3 servings) of KetoSoy, I use these steps with a <a href="http://amzn.com/B00LBFUKIA">Vitamix</a>.</p>

<p>Prep:</p>

<ul>
<li>210g of KetoSoy</li>
<li>84g of <a href="http://amzn.com/B0015AQL1Q">flavorless protein powder</a></li>
<li>3 tablespoons of <a href="http://amzn.com/B00H889MGK">chia seeds</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Blend:</p>

<ol>
<li>Put the KetoSoy, protein powder, and chia seeds in a large container, like a <a href="http://amzn.com/B00MVMCUK8">Blender Bottle</a> or a re-used, clean and empty KetoSoy oil bottle with the top cut off</li>
<li>Add 8 cups of water to the Vitamix container</li>
<li>Add 10 tablespoons of the oil included with KetoSoy to the Vitamix container</li>
<li>Blend the water and oil to emulsify them</li>
<li>With the Vitamix on its lowest setting, slowly add the protein powder until it&rsquo;s blended</li>
<li>Slowly add the chia seeds, increasing the speed of the Vitamix as necessary</li>
<li>Slowly add the KetoSoy, increasing the speed of the Vitamix as necessary</li>
</ol>

<p>This process, while not perfect, has yielded the most repeatable results for me so far. If I run into any issues blending I&rsquo;ll pour out the contents of the Vitamix into the <a href="http://amzn.com/B00DCYNP2G">2-liter airtight pitcher</a> I plan to store the finished mixture in, then slowly pour it back into the Vitamix, starting at a low speed and increasing it until everything is properly blended.</p>

<p>You may have noticed I do not add the optional liquid sweetener. I find the flavor profile to be delicious without it, and the sweetener only ruins it. I only tried the liquid Stevia, for what it&rsquo;s worth.</p>

<p>The texture and taste are both wonderful, especially with the added protein powder and chia seeds.</p>

<h3 id="effects:1f2ff74c1d28d8917c4851633b66f3c1">Effects</h3>

<p>I did lose some weight, which might alarm people that know me. I went from 82kg to 77kg within the first week of KetoSoy (this leads me to believe ketosis was achieved, but I cannot confirm as I did not test it empirically). My weight does rapidly go back up to 80kg if I eat what I would normally eat all the time, which I now only eat sparingly (the pork chop at <a href="http://nopasf.com">NOPA</a>, the fried chicken at <a href="http://magnoliapub.com/">Magnolia</a>).</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t had any gastrointestinal issues with KetoSoy, something that Soylent users have <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/soylent/comments/32t042/lpt_drink_slowly_to_avoid_bloatinggas/">repeatedly</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/soylent/comments/2qaw3o/has_anyone_else_gotten_way_less_gas_with_soylent/">talked</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/soylent/comments/2cwxwq/day_7_official_soylent_still_having_gas/">about</a>.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t had any <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/soylent/comments/2uuqac/a_little_over_a_week_in_on_ketosoy/">mental fog</a>, though I do add ~500 calories (the added protein powder and chia seeds).</p>

<p>I also don&rsquo;t believe I actually ever get into ketosis (despite the weight loss), though I have yet to actually test this with the <a href="http://amzn.com/B001DCV9S6">test strips</a>. My breath never seems to become <a href="http://www.webmd.com/oral-health/features/low-carb-diets-can-cause-bad-breath">ketosis-breath</a>.</p>

<h3 id="do-i-recommend-it:1f2ff74c1d28d8917c4851633b66f3c1">Do I recommend it?</h3>

<p>Yes. The price is right, and the texture and taste is lovely.</p>

<p>Before I began this process I had full bloodwork done. After doing KetoSoy for a while longer I will get bloodwork done again to see if there are any changes, good or bad, and update this post with the results. The bloodwork I got back before showed me in fantastic health.</p>
