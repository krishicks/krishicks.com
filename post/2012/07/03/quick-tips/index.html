<main>
<p>The following are things I found very helpful, which you also may find make your day-to-day usage of Git more enjoyable.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="go-headless">Go HEADless</h2>

<p>In many (and perhaps all) cases HEAD is implied when no ref is given, such as the following equivalent statements:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log origin/master..HEAD
$ git log origin/master..
</code></pre>

<h2 id="upstream-reference">Upstream reference</h2>

<p>Before you start referring to the upstream, you&rsquo;ll want to do a <code>git fetch</code> to update your refs/heads:</p>

<pre><code>$ git fetch
</code></pre>

<p>You only need to do this once in a while, or whenever you know the upstream to have changed.</p>

<p>You can refer to the upstream of any branchname or otherwise symbolic-ref by appending <code>@{u}</code> to the ref, such as:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log master@{u}
</code></pre>

<p>If you just want the upstream of the current branch, whatever it may be, you can replace master from above with HEAD:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log HEAD@{u}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="upstream-difference">Upstream difference</h2>

<p>Often, I&rsquo;ll want to see what commits are on upstream that I don&rsquo;t have. I usually will do this via:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log @{u}..
</code></pre>

<p>Which, when on master, is equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log origin/master..HEAD
</code></pre>

<p>You can see the reverse difference, or the commits are on the remote that you don&rsquo;t have, by reversing the range:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log ..@{u}
</code></pre>

<p>Which, again on master, is equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log HEAD..origin/master
</code></pre>

<p><em>To see the full list of formats recognizable, see <code>git revisions --help</code></em></p>

<p>If you want to see both of the above at the same time, you can use <code>git log</code> with the &ndash;left-right parameter. I&rsquo;ve also included &ndash;format=&rdquo; and &ndash;oneline (which must be passed in that order), which may be optional depending on your format configuration, but for me are not:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log HEAD@{u}...HEAD --left-right --format='' --oneline
</code></pre>

<p>Which can be shortened to:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log @{u}... --left-right --format='' --oneline
</code></pre>

<p><em>Note: The above example uses three dots, not two, to show only the commits which are reachable as ancestors of one branch but not the other.</em></p>

<p>You can replace HEAD in the above with any symbolic-ref or branchname to use as a reference instead. The output (with the format given previously) will look like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt; e86bd83 D
&lt; 6ea2155 C
&gt; eb2de55 B
&gt; 74829bd A
</code></pre>

<p>Commits beginning with &ldquo;&lt;&rdquo; are only on the left side of the triple-dot (in this case, the upstream), commits beginning with &ldquo;&gt;&rdquo; are only on the right side (in this case, the current branch). A..D are the commit messages.</p>

<h2 id="is-it-merged">Is it merged?</h2>

<p>To find out if a particular branch has been merged into origin/master, you could dig through the log on master and search for it:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log origin/master
</code></pre>

<p>Or, if you knew who would have merged it, you could limit the above with that:</p>

<pre><code>$ git log origin/master --author Kris
</code></pre>

<p>I wanted a better way, and I found it. I wanted to see if a particular branch had been merged to master without changing branches or having to dig through a log looking for the merge of the branch.</p>

<p>The situation that prompted this was that I had a topic branch, topicB, which depended on another topic branch, topicA. I wanted to see if topicA had been merged into master to find out if I could rebase onto master to get up to date, or if I should continue rebasing on top of the branch.</p>

<pre><code>$ git fetch
$ git branch --contains topicB@{u} -r
</code></pre>

<p>This gives you a list of all the remote branches that can reach (as an ancestor) the ref given. origin/master will be right at the top if the branch has been merged into it.</p>
