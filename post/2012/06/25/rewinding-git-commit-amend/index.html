<main>
<p>It may come to pass that you will run <code>git commit --amend</code> by mistake. When this happens, you&rsquo;ll want to unwind the operation you just did.</p>

<p>In some cases the changes are simple enough that you can use <a href="/blog/2012/05/16/git-reset-p/" title="git reset -p">git reset -p</a> to remove those lines from the commit. However, sometimes <code>git reset -p</code> isn&rsquo;t up to the task, as in the case when the changeset is very large. Luckily, git has a ticker tape of the changes you make to each branch, which is called the reflog.</p>

<p>The reflog records when the tip of a branch is updated. The tip is updated any time you create a new commit, amend a commit, reset a commit, switch branches, etc. Basically, any time HEAD changes, you will get a reflog entry. The reflog therefore is a great tool for understanding how the repository came to be in a particular state.</p>

<p><code>git reflog -2</code> will give you the last two operations that Git performed. In the case of an amend, it will look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>C HEAD@{0}: commit (amend): Something something something commit message
B HEAD@{1}: reset: moving to HEAD~1
</code></pre>

<p><code>git commit --amend</code> is kind of shorthand for the following, given changes have been made, and are either in the index or in the working directory:</p>

<pre><code>$ git stash
$ git reset HEAD~1
$ git stash pop
$ git add .
$ git commit
</code></pre>

<p>Or, in English:</p>

<ul>
<li>Save the changes that you want to apply to the HEAD commit off in the stash</li>
<li>Remove the HEAD commit and put its contents in the index</li>
<li>Apply the stashed changes to the working directory, adding them to the changes from the commit that was reset</li>
<li>Make a new commit</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, the last two operations in the reflog are <strong>reset</strong> and <strong>commit</strong>.</p>

<p>So, what can we do with this? Well, B was HEAD before the amend happened. C is the amended commit. <code>git diff C..B</code> will show you what changes were applied as part of the amend:</p>

<pre><code>$ git diff C..B
</code></pre>

<p>From here you can use <code>git apply</code> to apply the reverse of what you amended earlier to your working tree:</p>

<pre><code>$ git diff C..B | git apply -
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Note: The hyphen in <code>git apply -</code> causes <code>git apply</code> to take stdin as input.</li>
<li>Extra Note: The arguments to <code>git diff</code> are given in reverse order, with the later commit happening first to show the reverse of the amend. It&rsquo;s the same as doing <code>git diff B..C -R</code>, which reverses the diff output. Additionally, the -R argument may be applied to <code>git apply</code> instead of <code>git diff</code> to achieve the same effect.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now we can do another amend to put the commit back to where it was before we did the previous amend:</p>

<pre><code>$ git commit -a --amend -CHEAD
</code></pre>

<p>And then, by reversing the order of the refs to <code>git diff</code>, get the changes we want to apply to the correct commit back:</p>

<pre><code>$ git diff B..C | git apply -
</code></pre>

<p>And commit as necessary, this time using &ndash;fixup to indicate the correct commit (in this example, A):</p>

<pre><code>$ git commit -a --fixup A
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can rebase either now or at a later time to do the &lsquo;amend&rsquo; you had originally intended:</p>

<pre><code>$ git rebase --i --autosquash A~1
</code></pre>

<p>So don&rsquo;t fret when you do an accidental amend. It&rsquo;s just a couple commands away from being unwound and applied to the correct commit.</p>
