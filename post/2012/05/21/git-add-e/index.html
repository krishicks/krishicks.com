<p><code>git add -e</code> is like <code>git add -p</code>, except instead of adding things at the hunk level, you edit the entire patch at once.</p>

<p>Or, in other words, whereas <code>git add -p</code> will show you each hunk for every file and ask what you want to do for each of them, <code>git add -e</code> will show you the entire patch and allow you to edit it at will. I used this trick to recently split apart one massive commit into 28 smaller, digestible ones.</p>

<p>Say you&rsquo;ve replaced a line containing &ldquo;baz&rdquo; with one containing &ldquo;bar&rdquo;. When you <code>git add -e</code>, you&rsquo;ll be presented with a diff like so:</p>

<pre><code>foo
- baz
+ bar
</code></pre>

<p>From here you can decide, actually, you don&rsquo;t want to delete baz, you just want to add bar. And you want to add it above baz.</p>

<p>From this spot you can just change the minus to a space, making that line context for the diff. Then you can move the line that adds bar above baz, with this result:</p>

<pre><code>foo
+ bar
baz
</code></pre>

<p>After saving and closing the editor you&rsquo;ll be able to look at the result of your work in the index with <code>git diff --cached</code>:</p>

<pre><code>foo
+ bar
baz
</code></pre>

<p>And the line you made into context remains in your working directory, which you can see with <code>git diff</code>:</p>

<pre><code>foo
bar
-baz
</code></pre>

<p>But what if you end up modifying the diff in a way that makes it a patch that doesn&rsquo;t apply? Git&rsquo;s got you covered there.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say that when you moved bar above baz, after removing the minus from baz, you added an extra line on accident, making the patch invalid:</p>

<pre><code>foo

+ bar
baz
</code></pre>

<p>When you save and close the editor Git will tell you of the problem:</p>

<pre><code>error: patch failed: &amp;lt;some_filename&amp;gt;:1
error: file.txt: patch does not apply
fatal: Could not apply '.git/ADD_EDIT.patch'
</code></pre>

<p>In which case you&rsquo;ll be able to attempt the <code>add -e</code> again, as Git will not have made any changes to the working directory or index at this point.</p>

<p>In some cases Git will attempt to apply the patch and give you the option of retrying the add, re-opening the editor with the modified .git/ADD_EDIT.patch if you choose to retry. If you don&rsquo;t choose to retry, Git will delete .git/ADD_EDIT.patch.</p>

<p>In addition to editing the patch wholesale via <code>git add -e</code>, you can also choose <em>during <code>git add -p</code></em> to edit a particular hunk manually by choosing &lsquo;e&rsquo; to edit it instead of simply adding it via &lsquo;a&rsquo;. You can also add a file glob to the end of <code>add -e</code> as you would any other command to limit the size of the patch you&rsquo;re about to edit.</p>
