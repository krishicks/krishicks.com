<p>(Update #1 below)</p>

<p>Say you&rsquo;re going to do an interactive rebase where you&rsquo;re going to be squashing commits or reordering them. During this process you may want Git to execute a command after applying certain items of the todo list. An example of this would be when you want to run <code>rake</code> or similar to ensure a newly-squashed commit is still green.</p>

<p>You can do this by adding a task to the todo list, <code>exec</code>, followed by the command you&rsquo;d like Git to run at that point in the rebase. If the command you specify should return a non-zero exit code, Git will pause the rebase and allow you to sort it out, in the same way that it pauses when a conflict arises while applying the todo list during any other rebase.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of the above situation, where two commits are going to be squashed, and I want Git to run <code>rake</code> after it does the squash.</p>

<p>Pre-edits, this would look like:</p>

<pre><code>pick dad8d12 Commit #1
pick f613ac1 Commit #2
pick 58822ee Commit #3
</code></pre>

<p>Post-edits, this would look like:</p>

<pre><code>pick dad8d12 Commit #1
f f613ac1 Commit #2
x rake
pick 58822ee Commit #3
</code></pre>

<p>What happens here is Git will fixup Commit #2 into Commit #1, creating a new commit, then run <code>rake</code>. If <code>rake</code> returns a zero exit code, Git applies Commit #3 and completes the rebase. If <code>rake</code> had returned a non-zero exit code, Git would have paused the rebase operation at that point, allowing any necessary changes to be made to the HEAD commit, which is the squashed #1/#2.</p>

<p>I typically do this separate from doing an initial rebase, where I rebased and made a change to Commit #1 and had to resolve conflicts throughout the rest of the commits. This way I can keep my head straight while doing the rebase, then fix anything I missed as a second operation.</p>

<p>Update #1: As of Git 1.7.12 you can pass <code>-x &lt;cmd&gt;</code> to <code>git rebase -i</code> to have Git run the exec command after every commit in the resulting history: <code>git rebase -i &lt;treeish&gt; -x &lt;cmd&gt;</code>.</p>
