<p>There have been times where I performed a rebase and had to resolve conflicts as part of the rebase, and then decided to abort the rebase for one reason or another.</p>

<p>Without <code>rerere</code> the next time I went to perform the rebase I&rsquo;d end up having to resolve at least some of the same conflicts I had previously, which is annoying.</p>

<p>This is where <code>rerere</code> comes in.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&ldquo;rerere&rdquo; stands for <strong>re</strong>use <strong>re</strong>corded <strong>re</strong>solution.</p>

<p>What <code>rerere</code> does is save the resolution of a conflict so that it can be re-applied later if it sees the same conflict again. When Git sees the conflict which it already has a resolution recorded for, it will apply the resolution automatically for you, and give you the opportunity to accept the resolution as applied, or change it.</p>

<p>Turning it on can be done two ways: set it as a configuration parameter using <code>git config rerere.enabled true</code>, or use it only when you think you might need it with <code>git rerere</code> both before and after the resolution of a conflict.</p>

<p>*A more verbose explanation of <code>rerere</code> exists in Scott Chacon&rsquo;s <strong>Pro Git</strong>*.</p>
