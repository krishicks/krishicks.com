<p>Here are some notes about Forza 6:</p>

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>The intro movie is annoyingly unskippable.</li>
<li>The initial race has all assists set to max, which makes it very boring, and is also unskippable.</li>
<li>When the initial race is complete and the rest of the game hasn&rsquo;t yet been installed, a message, &ldquo;Installing content. You are free to continue playing while the installation completes.&rdquo; is shown, but there is nothing you can do at that point but wait.</li>
<li>The annoying female voiceover remains, and is not able to be muted.</li>
<li>Why is there so much voiceover instruction? This game isn&rsquo;t so complicated. And the voicover instructions aren&rsquo;t skippable, nor do they have subtitles.</li>
<li>The (A) Select and (B) Back overlay in the lower right of the screen is often hard to notice or read, and is shown in response to a modal question, which is only a voiceover.</li>
<li>Voiceovers happen after pretty much every single button press in the first few minutes of the game, and aren&rsquo;t skippable.</li>
<li>Changing driver difficulty plays the little video of your car driving up to the pits again, for some reason.</li>
<li>You still can&rsquo;t mute the UI sounds like you could in Forza 4.</li>
<li>Free look when selecting paint for a new car works similarly to Forzavista.</li>
<li>You are repeatedly forced to start consecutive races without being able to exit to the main menu.</li>
<li>You can buy mods just before starting a race, at least in career mode.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="compared-to-forza-5">Compared to Forza 5</h2>

<ul>
<li>You can no longer change the view while rewinding.</li>
<li>You can skip the &ldquo;This is your..&rdquo; voiceover when you buy a new car.</li>
<li>The same kinds of hits that used to shatter window glass no longer do.</li>
<li>You can once again tune your car just before starting a race.</li>
<li>Many cars in the game have what appears to be flat/matte paint</li>
<li>Pressing &ldquo;A&rdquo; while rewinding no longer plays a sound.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bugs">Bugs</h2>

<ul>
<li>At the start of a race, the view changes to that of cockpit, then to the view you actually have set.</li>
<li>Colliding with the rear of the car in front of you rarely, if ever, produces a sound.</li>
<li>Your place (upper left) re-renders itself with a sliding animation at random, even when place doesn&rsquo;t change.</li>
</ul>

<p>This list will be updated as I continue playing.</p>
