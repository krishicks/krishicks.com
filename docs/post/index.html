The makers of that software claimed that, by blocking blue light in sync with the setting of the sun, it would allow you to sleep better as viewing blue light disrupts the sleep cycle.
I tried it out and decided I liked the effect; I didn't do a scientific study to determine whether my sleep habits were improved, but I did notice I found screens far more pleasant to view at night than without running f.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a><p class="note labels"><a class="category" href="/categories/reviews/">reviews</a></p></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/post/viral-meningitis/">
            <p class="note title">Experience Report: Viral Meningitis</p><p class="note date">31 July 2017</p><p class="note content">A few weeks ago I experienced some mild stomach cramps that reminded me of food poisoning at the beginning of the week. As the week dragged on the stomach cramps came and went. I figured it was just mild food poisoning, and it'd be gone soon enough. I chewed some bismuth subsalicylate tablets and didn't think too much more about it.
At the end of the week there was a small bit of lethargy that I experienced, enough to make me go home early from work.<span class="mldr">&mldr;more</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/post/pipeline-design-with-concourse/">
            <p class="note title">Pipeline Design with Concourse</p><p class="note date">7 January 2017</p><p class="note content">Goulash Pipeline in Concourse
I recently made a CI/CD pipeline in Concourse for deploying Goulash. The pipeline definition can be found here.
Figuring out how to split up the work your pipeline needs to do in jobs and tasks in Concourse is not always obvious. The way you define jobs and tasks will determine how repeatable steps in your pipeline are, how fast jobs run, and how easily you can debug tasks.
In this post I will describe how I came to the job and task definitions in the pipeline for Goulash.

            <p class="note title">There is Always a Better Way</p><p class="note date">5 November 2016</p><p class="note content">I got into software development because of a single idea: there is always a better way.
I was working at a title insurance company in the US during the housing boom of 2007. I was hired as a temp to do data entry for the calculation of fees associated with purchasing title insurance. It was a straightforward job, with one incredible hindrance: everyone was using adding machines, which is a fancy desktop calculator that prints out a receipt as you enter calculations.

And you want to use mutual TLS, too. But maybe, like me, you couldn't easily figure out how to accomplish this, given the documentation and examples out there. Here's how I did it.

Without rerere the next time I went to perform the rebase I'd end up having to resolve at least some of the same conflicts I had previously, which is annoying.
This is where rerere comes in.
