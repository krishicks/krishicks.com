Here are some notes about Forza 6:

1. The intro movie is annoyingly unskippable.
1. The initial race has all assists set to max, which makes it very boring, and is also unskippable.
1. When the initial race is complete and the rest of the game hasn't yet been installed, a message, "Installing content. You are free to continue playing while the installation completes." is shown, but there is nothing you can do at that point but wait.
1. The annoying female voiceover remains, and is not able to be muted.
1. Why is there so much voiceover instruction? This game isn't so complicated. And the voicover instructions aren't skippable, nor do they have subtitles.
1. The (A) Select and (B) Back overlay in the lower right of the screen is often hard to notice or read, and is shown in response to a modal question, which is only a voiceover.
1. Voiceovers happen after pretty much every single button press in the first few minutes of the game, and aren't skippable.
1. You can no longer change the view while rewinding.
1. Changing driver difficulty plays the little video of your car driving up to the line, for some reason.
1. Pressing "A" while rewinding no longer plays a sound.
1. You still can't mute the UI sounds like you could in Forza 4.
1. You can skip the "This is your.." voiceover when you buy a new car.
1. Free look when selecting paint for a new car works similarly to Forzavista.
1. At the start of a race, the view changes to that of in-car, then to the view you actually have set.
1. Frequently you are forced to start consecutive races without being able to exit to the main menu.

This list will be updated as I continue playing.
