***This is a post about me being taking on too much responsibility and not doing enough to reduce it when I started to crack. I realized somewhat early on that I had taken on too much, but I didn't see any way to offload the work while continuing to develop products at the pace I'd maintained.***

In January 2017 I joined a team which had been in existence for about 3 months.

The team was not made up of people with more of a history in technical operations, where delivery of high-quality software was not their primary goal. The team had delivered a few products, but not necessarily the ones their users needed. This resulted in few people using any of their products. I saw a lot of room for improvement, both in quality of code and the product roadmap.

I ended up taking on a combined technical leadership and product management role on top of my role as software engineer, leaning on my decade of experience delivering software. I instituted rigorous testing and continuous integration and delivery pipelines. I ended up reviewing user stories created by the existing product manager, rewriting them as necessary when they didn't accurately convey the business need or were too vague to be worked on by the engineering team, giving this feedback to the product manager during or afterwards. I redirected the efforts of the team away from existing products that had few or zero users and towards products the users actually wanted and needed.

I was nearly, if not actually the sole creator of products like [pcf-pipelines](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pcf-pipelines), [pg2mysql](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/pg2mysql), and [yaml-patch](https://github.com/krishicks/yaml-patch). I also ended up taking on [creating](https://github.com/concourse/s3-resource/pull/75) [numerous](https://github.com/concourse/s3-resource/pull/78) [pull](https://github.com/concourse/fly/pull/171) [requests](https://github.com/concourse/atc/pull/190) to Concourse when I realized parts of pcf-pipelines that I'd designed required them. I led major refactoring efforts related to legacy code that I'd adopted from people that were no longer on the team.

As many of the products were open source, I also took on the job of triaging Github issues and pull requests, doing the needful to determine whether reported bugs were actual bugs, and figuring out whether a feature request was something the product should do. I reviewed pull requests, making similar calls about whether or not a particular pull request was appropriate to accept regardless of implementation, and if it was but the implementation lacking, did full reviews to get the original submitter to make changes to the pull request.

In agile software development there's a process of "acceptance", where a particular feature is determined to be fully and correctly implemented or if a bug fix actually fixes the bug. Because of my heavy ownership of all of the aforementioned duties, the person that was in the product management role on the team didn't have the proper context to be able to know how to accept a new feature I conceptualized, prioritized, and delivered, or how to determine a bug that I triaged, prioritized, and fixed was actually fixed.

This all got much worse when an additional, junior and non-technical PM was added to the team, ostensibly to take some burden off of the existing PM, but which only added to mine. Prior problems about understanding what a feature meant or how to accept a highly technical story were exacerbated.

As the months went on I became more and more worn down. I reached out to people I believed could make a positive change in the situation but no positive changes resulted.

I started having issues sleeping. I developed tight stress knots in muscles in my upper back that multiple sessions at a sports medicine therapist made barely a dent in. My mood soured; I started greatly disliking coming to work each day. I enjoyed coming up with new product ideas and banging them out, but I wasn't able to focus on just that given all the other duties I'd taken on. Having to interact with the other team members became unbearable.

I eventually decided it wasn't healthy and that I had to make a change. I requested to be moved to a different team as a way to force myself to relinquish the duties I'd taken on. At that point it was too late, however, and my request only made things worse.

By then I had distanced myself from the rest of the team pretty aggressively, still doing all the roles that I had taken on but not able to hide the fact that I didn't want to do them all anymore, and that I resented that I was doing all this work which should have been done by others without being compensated accordingly monetarily or in title.

The others did take note of my soured mood among them, however. They gave feedback to their managers that I was unpleasant to work with, regardless of the fact that I was doing a considerable portion of what should have been their job.

Eventually, I was put on notice. I received a Final Warning that my behavior was unacceptable and that I'd be let go if I didn't change things. This part of the story is still unfolding.

Looking back on things, I realize I made some mistakes. I took on too much work, ending up becoming a one-man product development shop, siloed in many ways from the rest of the team, while not giving enough feedback to my manager about the effect it was having on me. I was also breaking the rules; at Pivotal everyone is meant to pair-program but I'd skirted that since I joined this team, having discovered previously I was burned out on that, too.

I kept too much inside and focused too much on delivery and not enough on my health and well-being, and the effect that had on my coworkers. I managed not to take a vacation for over a year; it was only after I'd reached a breaking point that I forced myself to take a brief vacation.

Both of my parents are workaholics, so it's no surprise to me that I'm one as well. However, I need to better recognize when I put myself into a situation where I've taken on more than I can handle for long periods of time, and make changes before the negatives outweigh the positives of doing so much.
