# Hi,

I'm Kris.

I taught myself Ruby in 2007 to solve a data entry problem. I did a couple of presentations on the automation framework I wrote and ended up getting a job at [ThoughtWorks](http://www.thoughtworks.com), where I hoped to (and did) grow as a developer by learning from highly talented people.

I then moved to NYC and joined [Pivotal Labs](http://www.pivotallabs.com), where I continued to grow and learn new technologies: I helped write an [iOS app](http://flywheel.com/san-francisco), had my first foray into Java at [Intent Media](http://intentmedia.com), and continued to build my knowledge of [Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org).

I left Pivotal Labs for a startup, [DaisyBill](http://www.daisybill.com), where I ended up becoming the CTO and sole developer until I left to do contract work at [Pivotal](http://www.pivotal.io) in San Francisco, where I worked on two parts of [CloudFoundry](http://pivotal.io/platform-as-a-service/pivotal-cloud-foundry), [BOSH](http://www.bosh.io) and [Diego](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-design-notes).

I am presently working at <a href='http://pivotal.io'>Pivotal</a> in San Francisco as a Principal Software Engineer.

My resume is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/krishicks/resume).

### Thanks
